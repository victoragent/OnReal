## Why
OnReal currently lacks a public-facing landing page summarizing the platform for prospective developers.
A dedicated marketing page at the root route will help teams understand the value proposition and drive conversions to trials or documentation.

## What Changes
- Introduce a responsive hero, feature highlights, and CTA sections for the `/` route using the existing Next.js + Tailwind stack.
- Provide clear pathways to request access and explore docs so developer visitors can take the next step.
- Ensure copy, layout, and metadata align with the "Operating System for Real World Assets" positioning.

## Impact
- Marketing and developer relations teams gain a single place to direct traffic.
- Visitors can immediately learn core benefits and request onboarding without navigating the product UI.
- Establishes a foundation for future marketing modules such as testimonials or pricing.
